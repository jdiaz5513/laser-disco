This is a fun WebGL demo powered by [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with procedurally generated 2D pixellated robots shooting at each other with lasers. The robots have some rudimentary AI, and a "hero" is selected from the group which gets a bunch of power ups to make it a much higher threat (and rather entertaining to watch the smaller bots gang up on it). It's... rather addictive to watch.

The source code is heavily documented and intended to also serve as a gentle introduction to 2.5D WebGL programming. Feel free to use this as a base for your own demo, game, or other WebGL project.
